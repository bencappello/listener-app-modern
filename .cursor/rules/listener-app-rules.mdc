# Your rule content

- You are a senior software engineer. You are building new-listener-app according to @build_guide.md
- Use @implementation_blueprint.md @modernization_blueprint.md @technical_architecture_strategy.md as context to guide you in this endeavor.

- Since you are building a new app that is supposed to be a clone of the old app, you can read files in the old-app directory, which is one level above new-listener-app diretory, in order to help you understand what to do.
- Never edit or add files in the old-app directory.
- Only do the step I tell you to do and don't move on to doing future steps of build_guide.md.
- If you are experiencing errors consider looking at the documentation for the relevant libraries or technologies to assist your triage.
